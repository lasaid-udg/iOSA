It enhances the diagnostic process by supporting data integrity and security. The iOSA System aids physicians in improving OSA diagnosis efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings.

iOSA is designed to manage patient profiles, store data related to OSA, export the data to specific reports, and detect patterns between the stored data.
